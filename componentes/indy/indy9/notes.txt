Directory layout
----------------

source		- basic Indy source
demo		- basic indy demoes
units		- dir to store compiled units (not used)
lazarus		- designtime stuff
docs		- readme's and license info that came with indy9 snapshot
delphibuild	- dpk's and other Delphi build system related stuff.
delphizlib	- Some .objs that implement zlib. FPC will use paszlib or own zlib.
utils		- Indy has two utils lspfix and computil. Workaround Delphi bugs mostly


FPC/lazarus version info
------------------------

At the moment of writing, you want a development snapshot as recent as possible. Most
changes required to compile indy without mods were only included in early september.


General changes that I'd like to have migrated back into Indy9:
---------------------------------------------------------------

- balance comments above interface section. Mostly these are the
        lines added by CVS $Log: $.
        We had the same problem with FPC; fix all occurances now,
        and make sure $Log is on an otherwise empty line without {}'s,
        and it will be ok in the future.
- put {$i idcompilerdefines.inc} after interface keyword and in every demo after program xx;
    This will avoid having to specify a lot of defines. Maybe it is better to have a separate
	include for main programs than for units.
- idcompilerdefines.inc:
            - added an entry for FPC based on D7 entry
	     - ifndefed fpc ifdef linux entry. More work to do for *nix.


Unix related that need fixes
----------------------------
- about 71 ifdef linux occurances that will have to be fixed.
	- split into linux-kylix (unit libc using), and unix-generic (towards FPC's own libs)


Indy related fixes relative to FPC 2.0:
---------------------------

(SVN revisions: 1051 1034 1030 1029 1028 1016)

- tregistry.create(permissions), fixed FPC side (2.0.1 sept 2th)
- tregistry.readstring threw exception on non existing keys. Apparantly
        Delphi implementation only nils the string.
- gettempfile also exists in a cleaned up (OS dependant) version in
        sysutils. Fixed by prefixing Windows. Michael made a more permanent
        fix by adding an correctly overloaded one to sysutils
- getsyslocale references syslocale which is not 100% compat. Solved
        by always returning cs88591 $ifdef fpc for now.
        (added missing fields to 2.0.1, inited to lang_eng etc for now)

idcookie:
- tmrews missing. Added naieve implementation based on
           one criticalsection to syncobjs while Jonas investigates
           a good implementation.
